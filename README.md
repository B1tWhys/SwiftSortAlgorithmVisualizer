This is a project which helps visualize how sorting algorithms work. It shows read operations in green, and it shows write operations in red. It is written so that it is easy to add more algorithms, however right now it only has Bubblesort and Quicksort. In the future I will be adding more.

Enjoy this here gif of it running:
